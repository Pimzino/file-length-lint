feat: implement bundling for improved performance and web compatibility

This commit implements esbuild bundling to significantly improve the extension's
performance and compatibility:

- Reduced extension size by 71% (from 15.34MB to 4.43MB)
- Decreased file count from 523 to 22 files for faster loading
- Added web compatibility for VS Code for Web environments
- Simplified build process with optimized npm scripts
- Updated documentation to reflect the improvements

Technical changes:
- Added esbuild as a development dependency
- Created esbuild.js configuration for bundling both extension and server
- Updated package.json scripts for streamlined development workflow
- Optimized .vscodeignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Updated VS Code tasks configuration for better development experience
- Bumped version to 0.0.6

This change addresses the VS Code warning about bundling extensions and
improves the overall user experience by making the extension load faster
and consume less disk space.
